SDE-KG: A Stochastic Dynamic Environment for Knowledge Graphs 

Abstract: State-of-the-art techniques that perform reasoning over large knowledge graphs incorporate a path-finder and a path-reasoner. The path-reasoner is a learning agent that performs the inference task by producing a relation. The path-finder is usually the knowledge graph environment that moves the agent to the next-hop entity. While the path-reasoner can work on a continuous state space, the knowledge graph environment on which it is being trained, operates on a discrete state space. This restricts the agent from deducing smarter decision paths. In this paper, a novel path-finder called Stochastic Dynamic Environment for Knowledge Graphs (SDE-KG) has been proposed. SDE-KG is a meta-framework that can be combined with many embedding methods to create a continuous function of the knowledge graph environment which may facilitate smarter multi-hop reasoning.
